# ProjectEuler-C-
Solutions to project Euler problems using C++

For this project I am using VS2017 Community.

I've put all of the problems under this repository, rather than separate ones that I initially did for Java.  I'm going to switch the Java ones over to using a single repository in the near future.

If you like solving programming problems relating to maths, please go to https://projecteuler.net/ before looking at my solutions.

I have decided to share these publically because the solutions are very easy to find anyway.  These are all my solutions, with very little outside help.

Please read the readme file in each project folder under this repository.
