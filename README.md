# ProjectEuler with C++

Solutions to project Euler problems using C++

For this project I am using VS2017 Community.

I've put all of the problems under this repository, rather than separate ones that I initially did for Java.  I'm going to switch the Java ones over to using a single repository in the near future.

If you like solving programming problems relating to maths, please go to https://projecteuler.net/ before looking at my solutions.

I have decided to share these publically because the solutions are very easy to find anyway.  These are all my solutions, with very little outside help.  I have not copied or even looked at any other solutions, but there were a couple of problems that I did a bit of research into prior to solving them.

Please read the readme file in each project folder under this repository.
